            <h3>What is New York City Council, and how does it work?</h3>

            <p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Council'>New York City Council</a> is the lawmaking body of New York City.</p>

            <p>The Council is made up of 51 council seats, with each representative typically serving a four year term.</p>

            <p>The Council is an equal partner with the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City'>Mayor</a> in governing New York City. Its responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Discussing and approving local legislation
                </li>
                <li>
                    Making <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_use'>land use decisions</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Approving the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budget'>city's budget</a>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>Below are the primary types of city council activity.</p>

            <table class="table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Legislation Type</th>
                        <th>Description</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                {% for leg_type in legislation_type_descriptions %}
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <i class="fa fa-fw fa-{{leg_type.fa_icon}}"></i> 
                            <a href="/search/?q=&selected_facets=bill_type_exact:{{leg_type.search_term}}">
                                {{leg_type.name}}
                            </a>
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            {% if leg_type.html_desc %}
                                <p>{{leg_type.desc|safe}}</p>
                            {% else %}
                                <p>{{leg_type.desc}}</p>
                            {% endif %}
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                {% endfor %}
                </tbody>
            </table>

            <p>
                <strong>Introductions</strong> are the most interesting type of legislation because they are proposals for new laws. Once an introduction is passed, it becomes a Local Law - <a href="http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=2328524&GUID=E0B4EE30-B5F7-4E90-9C97-CF96D5385E01" target="_blank">see all Local Laws for 2015</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of the Council's legislative action happens in <a href='/committees/'>committees</a>. Each committee meets in public hearings 2-3 times per month where proposed legislation is debated. Members of other government branches, as well as the public, are able to attend and comment at these hearings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Meetings of the entire Council, referred to as Stated Meetings, occur twice a month at City Hall. 
            </p>
